# Hey there! 👋 I'm Teja Nikhil

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a tech enthusiast and a passionate CS-AI researcher with a knack for unraveling AI breakthroughs and the nitty-gritty of modern systems — give me a new algorithm or a tool, and I’m hooked on understanding it inside out. My area of research involves optimization of distributed training on multi gpu cluster in a large scale specially on the LLM workloads. Here, you'll find my projects, experiments, and contributions to the open-source community. Refer my portfolio or reach out to me to know more about me.

## 🚀 About Me
- 🔭 I am an CS-AI researcher working on the intersection of networking, GPU and LLMs.
- 🌱 My current research involves integrating a temporal graph based algorithm to the optical circuit switches (current state of art in AI Data centers)
- Along side i am also working on creating a simulator that involves OCS switches for design space exploration in AI Datacenter.
- 👯 I’m open to collaborating on building innovative and useful products and research areas related to LLM optimization and multi gpu training optimization.
- 💬 Technically i am good at studying research papers and analyzing them and thereby connecting all the gaps and dots
- 📫 I am obsessed over "how" and "why" of LLMs and various technological advancements.
- ⚡ Fun fact: My research once led me down a rabbit hole so deep, I emerged with a conspiracy theory about why tabs vs. spaces is still a debate.
