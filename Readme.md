# Hey there! 👋 I'm Teja Nikhil

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a tech enthusiast and a passionate CS-AI researcher with a knack for unraveling AI breakthroughs and the nitty-gritty of modern systems — give me a new algorithm or a tool, and I’m hooked on understanding it inside out. My area of research involves optimization of distributed training on multi gpu cluster in a large scale specially on the LLM workloads. Here, you'll find my projects, experiments, and contributions to the open-source community. Refer my portfolio or reach out to me to know more about me.

## 🚀 About Me
- 🔭 I’m currently working on reducing the affect of high reconfiguration latency of optical curcuit switches during the large scale AI model training.
- 🌱 I’m currently developing a simulator using C++ that uses optical circuit switches for the purpose of design space exploration.
- 👯 I’m open to collaborating on research areas related to LLM optimization and multi gpu training optimization.
- 💬 Ask me about how networking impacts the field of AI, how transformer models work in an intuitive manner along with the internal mathemaics.
- 📫 Here is my 
- ⚡ Fun fact: My research once led me down a rabbit hole so deep, I emerged with a conspiracy theory about why tabs vs. spaces is still a debate.
