# Hey there! 👋 I'm Teja Nikhil

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a grad student pursuing an MS (and eyeing a PhD) in multi-GPU optimization, where I tinker with networking algorithms to make optical switches sing at scale. Think distributed systems, high-performance computing, and squeezing every drop of efficiency out of GPU clusters. Refer my portfolio or reach out to me to know more about me.

🔍 What Drives Me: "The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing." – Albert Einstein. I live by this—dissecting LLMs (especially Transformers), GPU programming, and the software stitching it all together. I’m hooked on understanding how things work.
🌱 Current Obsessions: Optimizing data flow for AI workloads, exploring how networking powers large-scale GPU setups, and figuring out what makes LLMs tick.
💻 Code & Tools: C/C++, Python, CUDA—whatever cracks the problem. I’m a firm believer in the 10,000-hour rule: mastery comes from grinding it out, one line at a time.
📝 Goals: Build, teach, and push the edges of distributed computing—whether it’s research, open-source projects.

The important thing is not to stop questioning. Curiosity has its own reason for existing.
Strongly believe the 10000 hrs rule in mastering a skill
