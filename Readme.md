# Hey there! 👋 I'm Teja Nikhil

Welcome to my GitHub! I’m a grad student pursuing an MS (and eyeing a PhD) in multi-GPU optimization, where I tinker with networking algorithms to make optical switches sing at scale. Think distributed systems, high-performance computing, and squeezing every drop of efficiency out of GPU clusters. Refer my portfolio or reach out to me to know more about me.
